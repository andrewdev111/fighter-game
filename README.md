## Technical Architecture

### Server (Node.js + WebSocket)

```javascript
// Core game loop runs at 60 FPS
this.tickInterval = 1000 / 60; // 16.67ms per tick

// Queue system with automatic matching
tryCreateMatch() {
  if (gameState.queue.length >= 2) {
    // Create room and start game automatically
  }
}
```

### Client (HTML5 + Canvas)

```javascript
// Three-screen navigation
1. Character Selection â†’ 2. Game Mode â†’ 3. Waiting â†’ 4. Game

// Real-time networking with interpolation
function updateNetworkPlayers(message) {
  // Smooth player movement synchronization
}
```
